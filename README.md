# cancer-detection-using-knn
This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to detect cancer using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. Cancer is a critical health concern, and early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. The k-NN algorithm is a simple yet effective classification method that can be applied to medical datasets to assist in cancer diagnosis.

Key Features:

Dataset: We provide the dataset used for training and testing the model. This dataset likely includes various features related to patient health, and the target variable represents the cancer diagnosis (e.g., malignant or benign).

Code: The repository includes Python code for implementing the k-NN algorithm for cancer detection. This code encompasses data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation.

Jupyter Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks are often included to showcase the step-by-step process of building and evaluating the k-NN model. These notebooks can serve as educational resources for those interested in understanding the project's methodology.

Documentation: You'll find documentation or README files that explain the project's purpose, how to set up the environment, and how to run the code.

Results: The repository may also include information about the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the k-NN approach in cancer detection.

Contributions and Feedback:

Contributions and feedback from the open-source community are highly encouraged. If you have ideas for improving the model's performance, extending its functionality, or enhancing the documentation, please feel free to contribute or provide suggestions.
